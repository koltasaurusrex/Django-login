# Overview

I designed this project as a way for me to learn more about Django and the built in databasing and templates that are available within.

Django-login displays a simple page with a login and registration. Once the user creates a profile and logs in, they are then redirected to the homepage but
now there is a logout option. Simple but it taught me a lot.

The server can be run from within the same directory as manage.py with the command `python manage.py runserver`
